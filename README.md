# PCR Trading Strategy
This project implements a Pivot Point Cumulative Ratio (PCR) trading strategy using options data. The strategy aims to identify potential buy and sell signals based on the relationship between the PCR value and the price movement.

Overview
The above project was implemented as a part of the Inter-Hostel Technical Competition, Kriti 2024 at IIT Guwahati. The PCR trading strategy involves analyzing the PCR value, which is the ratio of put options open interest to call options open interest, along with pivot points calculated from the price data. When certain conditions are met, buy or sell signals are generated.
